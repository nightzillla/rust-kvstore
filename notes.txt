Rust Overview
--------------
Rust is a systems - level programming language. 
"[Rust] deals with low-level detials of memory management, data representation, and concurryency".

" Rust is a language designed to guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed and mmemory usage. 

The main tooling within the Rust ecosystem is: 

rustic - The compiler whihc takes your Rust code and compiles it into binary (machine readable code)

rustup - The command line utility to install and update Rust 

cargo - is rust package manager 
-- use cargo new "any new project" to make a new project/ directory 

WHEN CREATING A NEW PROJECT!
----------------------------
in the terminal type: 
- cargo new kvstore
this will create a binary (application) `kvstore` package

to typecheck 
- cargo check
The main.rs file is the default entry point for your application.
The Cargo.toml file is the manifest used by cargo to managne your project metadata. This is similar to a package dot json file 

to see the output
step 1. rustc ./src/main.rs
step 2. ls 
step 3. ./main  --> you should see Hello, world!

Variables in Rust
- You can declare variables using the let, const, or static keywords: 
- exampls 
let my_variable = 0;
const MY_CONSTANT: u8 = 0;
static MY_STATIC: u8 = 0;

By default, all variables are immutable. You can make a variable mutable by using mut keyword: 
example 

let mut my_mutable_variable = 0;
